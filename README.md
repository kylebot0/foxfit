# FoxFit

The Foxfit platform is a mobile application for children and a website for care counselors that aims to treat children with asthma by motivating and supporting them to exercise more. Foxfit is part of the SIMBA study and is currently conducting a pilot.

Treating asthma
Foxfit works with a exercise monitor to help children with asthma plan and actually perform their exercise activities. Developed by [GainPlay Studio](https://www.gainplaystudio.nl/) in close collaboration with the [Amsterdam University of applied sciences](https://www.hva.nl/).
